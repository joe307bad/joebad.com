## Senior Software Engineer at SoftWriters
**March 2024 - present**

**Links:** [SoftWriters](https://frameworkltc.com/) • [FrameworkFlow Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frameworkflow&hl=en_US&gl=US) • [FrameworkPOD iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frameworkpod/id1581605792)

Senior lead of FrameworkCourier, an application written in C# which is responsible for tracking the chain of custody of prescriptions through a system of pharmacies and facilities.

Designed and implemented a suite of mobile applications written in React Native that make pharmacies more efficient in packaging and reviewing prescriptions.

Planned and developed a cross-team project that used Large Language Models to give pharmacies better auditing tools by translating natural language to executable SQL statements.

Built a proof of concept written in full-stack F# that uses HTTP only cookie authorization with an OIDC provider (Keycloak). This prototype enables retail pharmacies to independently build on top of FrameworkLTC's infrastructure.

**Required Skills:** Expert level in C#, TypeScript, React Native, Git, cloud services, service-oriented architecture at scale, Agile software development, and interfacing with multiple team leaders to achieve common product goals.

## Front-End Engineer II at Amazon Web Services (AWS)
**May 2022 - March 2024**

**Focus Areas:** Performance • Observability • Accessibility

**Required Skills:** React • Redux • TypeScript • React Query • Full-stack • RxJS • Project management • Micro frontends

**Links:** [AWS CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html)

Individual contributor for the CloudWatch Logs (CWL) team. Maintained a feature rich AWS micro frontend that provides visualizations and insights into web service logs running at a global scale. Implemented accessible and internationalized features that provided real time data to millions of users. As the world leader in monitoring solutions, this frontend team had to make critical considerations for thousands of different user devices and internet capability variations. Also, I collaborated with service teams on developing high quality, high volume, and highly available services.

This role requires an expert skill level in frontend system design, React, TypeScript, and working in a rigorous, impactful, and highly complex development environment which orchestrates thousands of frontend packages deployed independently.

### Accomplishments

- **November 2023** - Contributed to the planning, development, and launch of [CloudWatch Logs anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/LogsAnomalyDetection.html). My primary responsibility was building the user experience for log pattern analysis, log anomaly detection, and log pattern comparison using TypeScript, React, Redux, and React Query. My other responsibilities included curating a backlog of ranked feature improvements and bug fixes, planning cross-feature integrations (e.g. integration with data protection, query generation, cross-account functionality), and coordinating a high-impact launch during AWS's main conference (re:Invent).

- **August 2023** - Lead the CWL team in migrating our entire API layer from one legacy backend service to a new, more secure backend service. This project required coordination with ongoing feature development, deep investigation into many packages to determine all legacy API usage, intricate monitoring and observability into the progress of the migration, fielding unknown service differences without customer impact, and accomplishing the migration without affecting console uptime.
