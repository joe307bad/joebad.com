## Final Elo+ Ratings

This system adapts the [FiveThirtyEight NFL ELO ratings](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/) to baseball, using [baseballr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baseballr) for data collection and [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) for machine learning.

The Elo+ ratings were generated based on wins, loses and advanced team, pitching, and batting statistics gathered from baseball-reference.com and FanGraphs. 

This system runs the Elo rating formula across 700 games from the beginning of the 2024, then uses that data to train a machine learning model. The model looks at who actually won each game and compares it to what the Elo ratings predicted. When there's an upset - where a team with better pitching, batting, and overall record still loses - the ML model learns from this and adjusts how it calculates future Elo ratings to better account for these kinds of surprises.

**The Elo+ model achieved a 10.4% improvement in predictive accuracy over standard Elo ratings using an 80/20 train-test split validation methodology.**
