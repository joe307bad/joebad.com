## What is Elo?

[Elo rating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) have found widespread application in competitive sports analytics. Nate Silver applied Elo ratings to [baseball in 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060822122806/http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5247) for Baseball Prospectus and later expanded the approach to [NFL predictions in 2014](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/) for FiveThirtyEight. These systems have proven highly effective for quantifying team strength and performance trends.  

## Expanding on Elo with ML

The Elo+ rating system starts <span id="1-back-to-top">[^[1]^](#1)</span> with traditional Elo ratings that rank baseball teams based on wins and losses, similar to how chess players are ranked. It then trains a machine learning model using advanced baseball statistics like pitcher WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched), OPS differential (on-base plus slugging percentage difference), and FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) to predict game outcomes with a confidence score. 

When the model is highly confident in its prediction (above 60% threshold), the system applies a small adjustment to the traditional Elo rating based on whether the model's prediction was accurate. If the model correctly predicts an upset or dominant performance, teams get bonus points added to their rating, but if the model is confident yet wrong, points are subtracted as a penalty. This creates enhanced "Elo+" ratings that combine the reliability of traditional win-loss records with the predictive power of advanced baseball analytics and supervised learning algorithms.

**The Elo+ model analyzed all 2,430 MLB games from 2024 and achieved a 8.4% improvement in predictive accuracy over the baseline <span id="2-back-to-top">[^[2]^](#2)</span> using a [80/20 train-test split validation methodology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/prepare-data-ml-net#split-data-into-training--test-sets).**

<span id="1">1.</span> The Elo+ rating system uses [baseballr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baseballr) for data collection and [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) for advanced machine learning capabilities. <a href="#1-back-to-top">^</a>

<span id="2">2.</span> The baseline is the simplest possible prediction strategy. For Elo+, the baseline is always picking the home team to win. If the ML model beats this baseline by 8.5%, it means the model's accuracy is 8.5 percentage points higher than this naive approach. This shows the model has learned meaningful patterns beyond just picking the most common outcome. <a href="#2-back-to-top">^</a>
