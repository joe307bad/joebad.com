## What is Elo?

[Elo rating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) have found widespread application in competitive sports analytics. Nate Silver applied Elo ratings to [baseball in 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060822122806/http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5247) for Baseball Prospectus and later expanded the approach to [NFL predictions in 2014](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/) for FiveThirtyEight. These systems have proven highly effective for quantifying team strength and performance trends.  

## Expanding on Elo with ML

The Elo+ rating system starts <span id="1-back-to-top">[^[1]^](#1)</span> with traditional Elo ratings that rank baseball teams based on wins and losses, similar to how chess players are ranked. It then trains a machine learning model using advanced baseball statistics like pitcher WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched), OPS differential (on-base plus slugging percentage difference), and FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) to predict game outcomes with a confidence score. 

When the model is highly confident in its prediction (above 60% threshold), the system applies a small adjustment to the traditional Elo rating based on whether the model's prediction was accurate. If the model correctly predicts an upset or dominant performance, teams get bonus points added to their rating, but if the model is confident yet wrong, points are subtracted as a penalty. This creates enhanced "Elo+" ratings that combine the reliability of traditional win-loss records with the predictive power of advanced baseball analytics and supervised learning algorithms.

**The Elo+ model analyzed all 2,430 MLB games from 2024 and achieved a 8.4% improvement in predictive accuracy over the baseline <span id="2-back-to-top">[^[2]^](#2)</span> using a [80/20 train-test split validation methodology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/prepare-data-ml-net#split-data-into-training--test-sets).**

## Deep dive into Elo+

When building machine learning models that can forecast future outcomes, there is always a black box of uncertainty. Certain questions arise: How was the model trained? How was it tested? What information does the modal have to make informed decisions? I am going to layout the answers to these questions for Elo+.

### First, let's cover terminology: 

• **Elo Rating** - Like a credit score for sports teams that goes up when they win and down when they lose. In Elo+, teams start at 1600 points and stronger teams have higher numbers.

• **K-Factor** - Controls how much a team's rating changes after each game. Set to 24 for baseball because even good teams
  lose often, so we don't want ratings to swing wildly after one game.

• **Home Field Advantage** - Extra points (68) added to the home team's rating before calculating win probability. This accounts for familiar surroundings, crowd support, and not having to travel.

### Machine Learning Terms:
• **Training/Validation/Test Split** - Like studying for a test: use some games to teach the system (training), some to fine-tune it (validation), and save some games it's never seen to measure real performance (testing).

• **Alpha Parameter** - The "volume knob" that controls how much we trust machine learning vs traditional Elo. At 0.3, we trust Elo 70% and ML 30% when making the final prediction.

• **Feature Engineering** - Choosing which baseball stats (ERA, WHIP, OPS) matter most for predicting games. Like picking the most important ingredients for a recipe.

### Baseball Statistics:
• **WHIP** - Walks plus hits per inning pitched; measures how many baserunners a pitcher allows. Lower is better for pitchers.

• **OPS** - On-base plus slugging percentage; measures how good hitters are at getting on base and hitting for power. Higher is better for batters.

• **FIP** - Fielding Independent Pitching; measures pitcher performance on things they control (strikeouts, walks, home runs), ignoring fielding. Lower is better.

And there are other advaned statistics we use to enhance predictions that won't be covered here.

### Performance Metrics:
• **Accuracy** - Simple percentage of games predicted correctly. Elo+ achieved 60.7% vs 52.2% baseline (always picking home team).

• **Log-Loss** - Confidence penalty score that punishes being very wrong when very confident. Lower numbers are better.

• **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)** - Ranking ability score measuring how well the system distinguishes good teams from bad teams. 0.5 is random guessing, 1.0 is perfect.

<span id="1">1.</span> The Elo+ rating system uses [baseballr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baseballr) for data collection and [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) for advanced machine learning capabilities. <a href="#1-back-to-top">^</a>

<span id="2">2.</span> The baseline is the simplest possible prediction strategy. For Elo+, the baseline is always picking the home team to win. If the ML model beats this baseline by 8.5%, it means the model's accuracy is 8.5 percentage points higher than this naive approach. This shows the model has learned meaningful patterns beyond just picking the most common outcome. <a href="#2-back-to-top">^</a>
