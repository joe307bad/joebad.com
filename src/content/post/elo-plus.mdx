## Overview

[Elo rating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) have found widespread application in competitive sports analytics. Nate Silver used Elo ratings for [baseball analysis in 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060822122806/http://baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5247) and later expanded the approach to [NFL predictions in 2014](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/). These systems have proven highly effective for quantifying team strength and performance trends. Building on this established foundation, the Elo+ rating system uses [baseballr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baseballr) for data collection and [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) for advanced machine learning capabilities.

The Elo+ ratings were generated based on wins, loses and advanced team, pitching, and batting statistics gathered from baseball-reference.com and FanGraphs. 

This system runs the Elo rating formula across 1,000 games from the beginning of the 2024, then uses that data to train a machine learning model. The model looks at who actually won each game and compares it to what the Elo ratings predicted. When there's an upset - where a team with better pitching, batting, and overall record still loses - the ML model learns from this and adjusts how it calculates future Elo ratings to better account for these kinds of surprises.

**The Elo+ model achieved a 13.3% improvement in predictive accuracy over standard Elo ratings using an [80/20 train-test split validation methodology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/prepare-data-ml-net#split-data-into-training--test-sets).**
