Individual contributor for the CloudWatch Logs (CWL) team. My team and I maintain a feature rich AWS micro frontend that provides visualizations and insights into web service logs running at a global scale. I've implemented accessible and internationalized features that provided real time data to millions of users. As the world leader in monitoring solutions, this frontend team has to make critical considerations for thousands of different user devices and internet capability variations. Also, I've collaborated with service teams on developing high quality, high volume, and highly available services.

This role requires an expert skill level in frontend system design, React, TypeScript, and working in a rigorous, impactful, and
highly complex development environment which orchestrates thousands of frontend packages deployed independently.

#### Accomplishments

- <strong>August 2023</strong> - Lead the CLW team in migrating our entire API layer from one legacy backend service to a new, more secure backend service. This project required coordination with ongoing feature development, deep investigation into many packages to determine all legacy API usage, intricate monitoring and observability into the progress of the migration, fielding unknown service differences without customer impact, and accomplishing the migration with no customer impact.
